			<h1>AP Java: Variables</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Think of a variable as a place to store a value that you will use later. Variables get their name because they
		can <em>vary</em> or change. If you previously studied JavaScript or Python, you are going to notice something different
		about Java. Variables have different <em>types</em> and every Java type has size limits. For example, integers are limited
	        to values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. Run the program below and you will get an error.
		The program is attempting to print the integer <code>123456789101112131415</code> which is too large.

		<p>A good way to think of Java variables is like a parking space. Parking
	        spaces have different types that can accomodate different sized vehicles.

		<p>For this class, you need to know 5 basic (also called <em>primitive</em>) types:

		<UL><b><code><li>int
			<li>float 
			<li>double 
			<li>boolean 
			<li>char</code></b></ul>

		
		<p>Parking spaces will contain different vehicles at different times, so some parking spaces are labeled to make it
		easier to find your parking space later. It's the same for Java variables. In addition to a <em>type</em> every Java variable
			has also has a <em>name</em>.

		of this parking space</em></figcaption>

			<h1>AP Java: Variables</h1>
		</header>
		<h2>Variable types and sizes</h2>
		<p>Think of a variable as a place to store a value that you will use later. Variables get their name because they
		can <em>vary</em> or change. If you previously studied JavaScript or Python, you are going to notice something different
		about Java. Variables have different <em>types</em> and every Java type has size limits. For example, integers are limited
	        to values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. Run the program below and you will get an error.
		The program is attempting to print the integer <code>123456789101112131415</code> which is too large.

		<p>A good way to think of Java variables is like a parking space. Parking
	        spaces have different types that can accomodate different sized vehicles.

		<figcaption><em>Just like parking spaces, there are different <em>types</em> of Java variables
		that can accomodate different values</em></figcaption>
		</center>
		<p>For this class, you need to know 5 basic (also called <em>primitive</em>) types: <b><code>int float double boolean 
			</code></b> and	<b><code>char</code></b>.
		<ul><li><code>int</code> holds a single integer value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647
		<li><code>float</code> a decimal value with up to 7 digits
		<li><code>double</code> a decimal value with up to 15 digits
		<li>A <code>boolean</code> can only hold values that are either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>
		<li><code>char</code> holds a single letter, digit, space or punctuation mark and must be enclosed in single quotes,
		like this: <code>'G'</code></ul>


		<h2>Variable names</h2>
		<p>Parking spaces will contain different vehicles at different times, so some parking spaces are labeled to make it
		easier to find your parking space later. It's the same for Java variables. In addition to a <em>type</em> every Java variable
			has also has a <em>name</em>.
		
		<br><center><img src="variables2.png">
		<figcaption><em>Every Java variable has a name. In our parking space analogy we could say that <code>G210</code> is the </em>name<em>
			of this parking space</em></figcaption></center>
		<p>You can pretty much choose any name you want for a variable with a few limitations. Variable names cannot 
			<ul><li>start with a number
			<li>contain a space
			<li>have a special meaning in Java</ul>
		<p>Words in Java that have a special meaning are called <em>reserved words</em> or <em>keywords</em>. Java has about 50 reserved words or keywords
			that you are not allowed to use as variable names such as <code>public</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>void</code>, <code>int</code> …

		<p>Because a Java variable name can’t have spaces, a style called <em>camelCase</em> is usually used for variable names 
			with more than one word. <em>camelCase</em> capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first word.
		Some examples are <code>firstName</code> and <code>numberOfDogs</code>.
 		Java variable names are case-sensitive, so <code>firstName</code> is not the same as <code>firstname</code> or <code>FirstName</code>.

		<p>
		</center>
		
		
		
		<h2>Variable declarations</h2>
		The Java statement that sets up a variable is called a declaration. Here’s an example declaration
		<h1><code><mark class="green">int</mark> <mark class="orange">num</mark>;</code></h1>
		The <mark class="green">first word</mark> of the declaration is the <em>type</em>. The <mark class="orange">second word</mark>
is the <em>n	name</em> that the programmer chooses. You can pretty much choose any name you want for a variable with a few
		limitations. Variable names cannot 
		<ul><li>start with a number</li>
		<li>contain a space</li>
		<li>have a special meaning in Java</li></ul>
		Java has about 50 <em>reserved words</em> or <em>keywords</em> that you are not allowed to use as variable names
		such as <code>public</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>void</code>, <code>int</code> …
		
		<p>Because a Java variable name can’t have spaces, a style called <em>camelCase</em> is usually used for variable names
		with more than one word. <em>camelCase</em> capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first word like
		<code>firstName</code> or <code>numberOfDogs</code>. Java variable names are case-sensitive, so <code>firstName</code> is
		not the same as <code>firstname</code> or <code>FirstName</code>.

		<h2>Variable initializations</h2>
		After a Java variable is declared, it needs to be <em>initialized</em>. Run the following program and you will get an 
		error message.
		<p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/612c6bf560" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>The English word <em>initial</em> means <em>first</em>. We initialize a variable by assigning (“setting it equal to”) its first value.
		We can fix the error in the program by adding <code>num=3;</code> between lines 4 & 5. (Note it doesn't have to be <code>3</code>, 
		we could use any integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647). Add an initialization between lines 4 and 5 and run the code
		again to verify that the error is fixed.
			
		<p>You can declare and initialize a variable with one line of code like
		<h1><code><mark class="blue">int num</mark><mark class="green"> = 3</mark>;</code></h1>
		Just remember that the one line of code is doing two different steps: <mark class="blue">the declaration</mark> and
		<mark class="green">the initialization</mark>

			<h1>AP Java: Variables</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Think of a variable as a place to store a value that you will use later. Variables get their name because they
		can <em>vary</em> or change. If you previously studied JavaScript or Python, you are going to notice something different
		about Java. Variables have different <em>types</em> and every Java type has size limits. For example, integers are limited
	        to values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. A good way to think of Java variables is like a parking space. Parking
	        spaces have different types that can accomodate different sized vehicles.

		<p>Every Java variable has a type and a name
